# Executable specs

A `*.spec.md` file is runnable documentation. Prose explains; specially-marked steps execute and are asserted, so the examples can never drift from the code. Files are discovered under `docs/**/*.spec.md` and run by the spec test harness.

## Execution contexts

Every Markdown heading opens an **execution context** that runs until the next heading of the same or higher level.

- Sibling contexts are **isolated**: each runs in its own fresh temporary working directory with its own environment.
- A context **inherits** its ancestors' preambles. An ancestor's *preamble* is the steps between that ancestor's heading and its first child heading. Inheritance accumulates down the whole ancestry (`#` → `##` → `###`).
- Only a **leaf** context (a heading with no child headings) is a test case. It runs its inherited preambles in order, then its own steps.

So given:

    # Tool
    ✏️FOO              ← inherited by every leaf under `# Tool`
    ```
    bar
    ```
    ## Group
    📄config.toml      ← inherited by every leaf under `## Group`
    ```toml
    ...
    ```
    ### Example A      ← a test: runs FOO + config.toml, then its own steps
    ### Example B      ← a separate, isolated test: same preamble, fresh dir

`Example A` and `Example B` each start from a clean temp dir with `FOO` set and `config.toml` written.

A section that contains the line `(example continued from previous section)` continues the previous section instead of starting fresh: it runs in the directory the previous section left behind, and its inherited preambles are skipped — their effect is already on disk. Sections chain in document order, so one continued section may follow another.

A continued section with no previous section is an error, so running one on its own (for example picked out by `pytest -k`) fails instead of silently missing its context.

## Steps

A step is a **marker** optionally followed by a fenced code block. The block's info string (` ```json `, ` ```markdown `, …) is cosmetic — only the marker decides the block's role. ` ```bash ` blocks are **reserved** for commands and are never consumed as another marker's payload.

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `📄<path>` + block | Write the block to `<path>` (relative to the temp dir). |
| `📄<path> @<src>` | Copy the repo file `<src>` to `<path>`. `<path>` defaults to `<src>` when omitted (`📄 @<src>`). For externalising large or irrelevant fixtures. |
| `✏️<VAR>` + block | Set environment variable `<VAR>` to the block's content. |
| `⌨️` + block | The block is **stdin** for the next command. |
| ` ```bash ` | Run the command (in the temp dir, with the pending stdin and current env). |
| `🖥️ ✅` / `🖥️ ❌ <N>` | Assert the last command's exit code is `0` / `<N>`. |
| `🚨` | Assert the last command's **stderr**. |

### Asserting output

`🖥️` and `🚨` may be followed by an expected-output block:

- **Block present** → the stream (stdout for `🖥️`, stderr for `🚨`) must equal it, after normalising: ANSI stripped, trailing whitespace per line removed, trailing blank lines dropped.
- **Block absent** → that stream is not checked.

To assert against volatile output (timestamps, absolute paths), scrub it in the command itself, e.g. `habit-mapper | sed 's/[0-9]*ms//'`.

Exit code defaults to `0`: a command with no following `🖥️`/`🚨` must still succeed, so setup steps fail the test if they fail. `🖥️ ❌ <N>` (or the shorthand `🚨️ ❌ <N>` for stderr-only failures) overrides it. Prefer keeping the exit code on the `🖥️` line and using `🚨` only for stderr.

### Skipping

A `🟡` at the end of a heading marks that test as **skipped** — the harness reports it as skipped, not run. Use it to land a spec for behaviour that isn't built yet without failing the suite, then remove it once the behaviour passes.

## Markers reference (codepoints)

Markers are matched by base codepoint; any U+FE0F variation selector is ignored, so `🖥️` and `🖥` are equivalent.
